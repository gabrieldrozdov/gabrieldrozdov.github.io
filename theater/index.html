        My experience in music dates back to high school, during which I trained in piano, violin, trumpet, music production, and composition. I was fortunate enough to have had training at NYU’s Clive Davis Institute for Recorded Music, Lagond Music School, Hoff-Barthelson Music School, and the Music Conservatory of Westchester. Nevertheless, I never worked in theater as I hadn’t had exposure to the performing arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started sound designing for theater at Wesleyan University, where I worked on numerous senior theses, faculty productions, and student projects. I was the Sound Specialist for Second Stage, Wesleyan’s student-run theater production company, from Mar. 2017 to May 2019 (when I graduated). Through Second Stage, I managed sound equipment for up to twelve productions a semester and played a more intimate role on shows that required creative or technical help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wesleyan didn’t offer a focus in sound design, so I treated the shows I worked on as opportunities to experiment with new techniques in design. I explored speaker placement, diegetic and non-diegetic audio, Foley, the physicality of low-frequency sounds, responsive compositions (that evolved or changed on cue), complex microphone setups, voice overs, soundscapes, underscoring, and more. My experience at Wesleyan culminated in my senior thesis, <em>No Replica</em>, which was a sound performance that reconceptualized performance as a perceptive phenomenon and used immutable sounds to replace actors. <em>No Replica</em> went up from Dec. 6-8, 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used my liberal arts education to specialize in several elements of theatrical production. For sound, I studied theory, ethnomusicology, ludomusicology, experimental music, and sound design through courses in the Music Department. In the Theater Department, I had extensive exposure to performance studies and studied lighting design and drafting. My work through Second Stage earned me deep administrative experience, wherein I personally advised shows and played a leadership role in the technical direction of several productions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of individuals have significantly influenced me to pursue sound and theater in greater depth. I want to take this moment to acknowledge them and thank them for their support and mentorship: Calvin O’Malley Anderson, Barbara Berg, John Catoliato, Anthony “Rusty” Cloud, Anthony Dean, Michael DeVito, Kate Galloway, Brian Landrus, Tatiana Longo, Cláudia Tatinge Nascimento, Bo Pericic, and Maddie Ulevich.
