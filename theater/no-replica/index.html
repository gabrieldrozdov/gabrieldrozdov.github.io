          <em>No Replica</em> is a sound performance. It’s a theater production but there are no actors. There will be speakers, and sounds will play out of those speakers—sometimes, different sounds will play from different speakers. Eventually, the performance will end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The house count for this production is very limited, so please attend if you reserve a seat.

          If you are unable to attend the performance, or have accessibility concerns, or there are no tickets left, please send an email to gdrozdov@wesleyan.edu with your specific circumstance.

          <strong>Action, by Sam Shepard</strong><br>
          A Directing Thesis by Ray Achan ‘19<br>
          '92 Patricelli Theater<br>
          Wednesday March 6, Thursday March 7, Friday March 8, 7pm<br>
          <br>
          This Obie-Award winning play takes us inside the living room of Liza, Lupe, Jeep and Shooter in the midst of a mysterious crisis. Limited food and overwhelming boredom begin to take their toll with disturbing and absurd results. Sam Shepard’s imaginative voice and deeply rooted characters has transformed American theater and constantly forces us to confront the strange and unknown.

          <strong>Myth in Performance Project</strong><br>
          Spring Faculty Theater Production<br>
          Directed by Visiting Assistant Professor Corey Sorenson
          CFA Theater<br>
          Friday April 12 & Saturday April 13 - 8pm, Saturday April 13 & Sunday April 14 - 2pm<br>
          <br>
          The Theater Department continues its exploration into myth with a new script under development by faculty member Corey Sorenson. A story of two secret lovers who go beyond death to find the meaning of living, this script looks at the fundamental myth of Orpheus, the use of myth by a major American playwright, and a contemporary response to both. Using music, movement and the power of language, this theatrical piece re-imagines and parallels Tennessee Williams’ <em>ORPHEUS DESCENDING</em>.

          <strong>Chase</strong><br>
          <em>A Playwriting Thesis by Wenxuan Xue ‘19</em><br>
          <em>This written work is created in partial fulfillment for Honors in Theater.</em><br>
          <br>
          The play follows Chase, a young Chinese queer singer-songwriter in New York City, struggling to come to terms with his traumatic memories through writing music. With the help of his sister, he learns to let go of his pain and move on to strengthen a new form of identity – one that makes him feel belonged and loved and supported in this seemingly isolating world. The play explores the intersectionality and the nuances of queerness and Asian diaspora, and what does it mean to embrace both identities in our increasingly globalized society today.

        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
          <strong>Co-Dependent</strong><br>
          <em>A Playwriting Thesis by Jordan Roe ‘19</em><br>
          <em>This written work is created in partial fulfillment for Honors in Theater.</em><br>
          <br>
          <em>Co-Dependent</em> follows protagonist Pat's last year of college as the end of an unhealthy friendship overlaps with the beginning of a new romance. The transition leads her to question some dangerous assumptions she has made about her self worth and consider what she's allowed to need for herself and from other people. What starts as a "casual hookup" agreement between Pat and new fling Henry has the chance to be so much more than their prescribed and gendered expectations. If only they can show up for each other (and for themselves) to face their fears of the dreaded c-word: co-dependence. The play deals with the tension between guilt and pleasure, control and craving, and vulnerability and individualism.

        <p style="margin-left:20px;">
          <strong>My Block</strong><br>
          <em>A Playwriting Thesis by Rodrick Edwards ‘19</em><br>
          <em>This written work is created in partial fulfillment for Honors in Theater.</em><br>
          <br>
          I want you to think of the place you call home. I want you to visualize your family. Or, that friend you did absolutely everything with. Or, the owner of the little corner store at the end of the street. Now what if that community was ripped apart? All that community support broken to the point where you question whether or not it ever existed. In My Block, we follow a family desperately trying to hold to their home. In the face of gentrification, displacement, urban renewal, and restoration. All terms the oppressive forces in our society use to further divide and weaken low income communities of color.
