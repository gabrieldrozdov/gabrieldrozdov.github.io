      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        SmartTix is a small ticketing company offering personalized service for live event ticketing through its website. I first encountered the organization through The 24 Hour Plays and soon learned that SmartTix was in need of a designer to update their visual identity. I proposed a freelance partnership to tackle this issue and the company accepted me into the position.
      </p>

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        SmartTix's website at the time was functional but lacked the "pop" of its higher-budget competitors. The design was neither mobile friendly or particular intuitive to navigate and need both a visual overhaul and a structural reconfiguration. The organization decided to use Bootstrap to easily incorporate responsive design and my role was to prototype a promotional page upon which the company would base the remainder of its site.

      <h3>Iterative Design</h3>
      <p>
        This project operated on a three-draft timeline. I would design and program a draft using provided copy and implementing required functionality. In response, my employer would provide feedback for the following iteration. We utilized this process to expedite the new design in a freelance-work format.
      </p>
      <p>
        This formula gave me the opportunity to fully explore Bootstrap and raw HTML/CSS/JavaScript web design. I researched publicly available templates and coding techniques to find inspiration and test out modern design aesthetics. Additionally, I had more time to try out ideas I was less sure about since I had the opportunity to significantly revise such designs in a later draft.
      </p>

      <h3>First Draft: Structural Work</h3>
      <p>
        The first draft took the longest to program and laid the fundamental framework for future iterations. I extensively studied Bootstrap's documentation to best incorporate CSS classes and efficiently test custom styles in a live environment. At the same time, I modernized SmartTix's aesthetic identity by introducing a brighter color palette with distinct shades of blue and developing iconography using these colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made sure to test the most difficult technical elements in this first draft as I didn't want to run into a large technical hurdle  down the road. I incorporated an animated header (using Adobe After Effects), a menu bar that transitioned from opaque to transparent as the user scrolled the page, parallax backgrounds, Google Fonts, and context-specific CSS animations. Once I was able to implement these, I could focus on  aesthetic changes without risk of breaking the page's functionality.

      <h3>Second Draft: Fixing and Testing</h3>
      <p>
        My employer received the first draft with high spirits, pushing for a more modern and personal identity in the next iteration. He also felt that the site was too monochrome and mechanical. In this second draft, I tried to push the prior design in new directions through small changes that changed the overall composition of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I eliminated the old-fashioned animated header in favor of one that better represented contemporary tickets. I tried an overly friendly handwritten font and replaced "realistic" icons with more representational ones using Font Awesome's free library. Furthermore, I differentiated less between individual sections to streamline the  page and better integrate call-to-action buttons. Finally, I introduced red hues to break up the blue monochromatic color scheme.

      <h1 class="text-number"><strong>6.</strong></h1>
      <h3>Final Draft: Polish and Flair</h3>
      <p>
        The changes from the first to second drafts received less positive feedback. To address this, I reverted to the aesthetic of the first draft and instead opted to simplify the entire design and use photographs and backgrounds to add flair. This meant abandoning many of the ideas I had developed but ending up with a much more polished final product.
      </p>
      <p>
        All considered, this draft placed the focus on the content rather than its presentation. This proved effective for making the page feel friendlier, while also coming off as professional. In this case, call-to-action buttons popped out and CSS animations aided in the user's navigation of the page instead of adding needless extra complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        See below for examples on how the CSS animations look in action.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
         My work with SmartTix was unique because it began with the objective to create a design someone else would expand upon. In most of my work, I prepare extensive documentation on how to implement my designs in future graphics, but I always take the initiative on my own. It was a completely different experience with SmartTix and ultimately allowed for more exploration of the design itself, ironically letting me not have to worry about how to accommodate future designers. Instead of writing documentation, I made sure my code was clear and legible. SmartTix has since rebranded using my page as the prototype for all other designs. <span style="color:#F71E5D;">&#9724;</span>
