      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The 24 Hour Plays is a producing company that specializes in time-limited theater. In just twenty-four hours, writers, directors, and actors write, rehearse, and perform original musical or plays on Broadway, Off-Broadway, or elsewhere. The company organizes celebrities and various other theater professionals to feature in several events each year, while also sponsoring licensed productions nationally and internationally.
      </p>
      <p>
        What started as a passion project for the company’s founders soon became an annual and seasonal event that frequently featured A-list celebrities seeking a fun outlet to experiment with new work. I joined The 24 Hour Plays when the company was preparing for its <em>The 24 Hour Musicals: Los Angeles</em> event as well as its intensive developing artist program, <em>The 24 Hour Plays: Nationals</em>. The company initially hired me to assist with administrative work during this preparation period, but my responsibilities quickly spilled into greater marketing and branding projects.

      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the very clear and unified mission statement of The 24 Hour Plays, the company’s branding was disorganized and inconsistent when I joined. The company relied on the celebrity status of each event’s participants by producing ads featuring said celebrities’ headshots and names. While not ineffective, this tactic had little means to unite different marketing graphics into the same brand except for superimposing a logo on each image. On top of all of this, the company’s website was outdated and difficult to maintain because of a poorly implemented back-end. All considered, marketing developments were at a standstill because they proved too time-consuming and expensive to pursue on top of producing new shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I joined as an administrative intern, I saw the company’s need for a designer but inability to hire one because of financial boundaries. I approached my boss about the issue and eventually presented a mockup of a new website that featured a revitalized brand aesthetic—this initial draft ultimately evolved into The 24 Hour Plays’ current website and branding. In this process, I had to address numerous issues that included resolving the website’s back-end, rebuilding every webpage from scratch, composing a manual for updating the site, and building a style guide for the development of future graphics.

      <h3>Assessing the Brand</h3>
      <p>
        The 24 Hour Plays has undergone branding projects in the past, but the relics of those initiatives barely remain. As far as I know, only two posters still exist of the prior major branding project (both of which live in founder Tina Fallon's office!). While their design is clean and attractive, it is no longer present in the organization's graphic identity. Therefore, I decided that it would instead be best to expand on the company's various in-use design elements to refine The 24 Hour Plays' image.
      </p>
      <p>
        I conducted visual research on the existing brand and identified several core elements: celebrity action shots, a mustard-ketchup color palette, bold uppercase typography (in Bebas Neue), and gritty textures. The issues with such elements mainly involved their inconsistency. To address this issue, I developed a framework for creating new graphics that fit the brand and developed numerous prototypes for demonstrating this aesthetic.

      <h3>Creating Assets</h3>
      <p>
        After workshopping several ideas, I decided the best (and most reproducible) design scheme consisted primarily of grid-based elements. These "block" graphics would feature of a variety of images albeit in the same identifiable style. Therefore, it would be easy to make new marketing images as new celebrity headshots and events came in, especially after my departure from the organization. In the same vein, I refocused the color palette to eliminate the mustard-ketchup problem and made yellow the prominent highlight color, while red (now more of an orange) became a background shade. I prioritized this color scheme because it simplified graphic development using a layer-based template and simultaneously introduced a fundamental iconic identity to all of the company's marketing assets.

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The underlying principle for my design was to facilitate in easy and maintainable web implementation. Grid-based elements work extremely well on responsive (i.e. mobile-friendly) websites and also pave the way for supplementary elements such as animations. I prototyped the site offline to implement this grid-based layout using the various graphic assets I had developed. I also incorporated numerous transition animations to give the simplistic site added character. Once I finished the offline draft, I migrated the company's backend from Drupal to WordPress and published the new design.

      <h3>Publicizing the New Identity</h3>
      <p>
        I managed to finish the site's first public iteration relatively quickly. This meant I had ample time to use the upcoming <em>The 24 Hour Musicals: Los Angeles</em> and <em>The 24 Hour Plays: Nationals</em> to publicize the new website and brand through marketing assets. Whereas web design restricts structure and formatting, print materials have no such boundaries and don't require strict templates. I explored the possibilities of the new design language through numerous advertisements and used these investigations into new designs as insights for improving on the website.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        When I joined The 24 Hour Plays, I had no intention to take on such a big project. I only realized the potential for improvement after joining the company and evaluating how the organization could best utilize my specific skillset. In this case, The 24 Hour Plays offered me the chance to spearhead a large design project and work on a scale I previously never had the opportunity to pursue, all while refreshing and revitalizing the company's face and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also understood that there would be no clear individual to take over my role after my departure since I reported directly to the company's executive director, Mark Armstrong. After finishing core development of new graphics, I worked tirelessly to make sure the organization had extensive documentation on what their brand is (aesthetically and technically), as well as how to update their WordPress site and navigate the backend. The experience was extremely educational and gratifying, and I feel successful in my efforts especially because the company has since maintained their website and brand without me. <span style="color:#F71E5D;">&#9724;</span>
