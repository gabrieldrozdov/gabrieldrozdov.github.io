          <p>
            I've had numerous jobs on Second Stage, none of which were explicitly "graphic design," but I still consider myself the graphic designer for the organization. I worked to maintain show information and images on the website, as well as develop several promotional materials and update the logo to look cleaner and more modern.

          I joined Red Feather not long after its founding, which made graphic design interesting since I was remaking assets that were no more than two years old. Still, since the previous students had graduated, I wanted to develop a more consistent bank of graphic assets that anyone could use and would always look pretty and identifiable.

        <p>
          <em>Musicircus</em> is this great crazy event where a bunch of students and teachers compose and perform experimental works all at once in the same room. I was a student in MUSC109: Introduction to Experimental Music, so I volunteered to make the poster during class.

        <p>
          I was originally just the assistant sound designer for <em>The Pillowman</em>, but I convinced Eddie to let me make the poster by asking him if I could make the poster. He told me he wanted the poster to be inspired by the intro sequence to <em>Se7en</em>, so I initially tried to do just that and then took it from there. We workshopped the design during production meetings and everyone seemed to be happy.

        <p>
          My time with The 24 Hour Plays was extremely fun, since the organization did not have a graphic designer and was in need of a website and brand redesign. I took the initiative with both, creating a new website as well as numerous assets and a style guide. The materials I created focused on the company's productions 'The 24 Hour Plays On Broadway' and 'The 24 Hour Nationals', but I made sure my materials could be used for future productions as well.

          My role as graphic designer for <em>Burying Gertrude Berg</em> was less creative, since Jordan had a couple posters ideas she really wanted to see through. The play was about TV sitcom star Gertrude Berg, and Jordan's poster ideas consisted of recreating old advertising assets with Jordan (who played Berg) in Berg's place.

          I did not realize I was going to be the graphic designer for this show, as I was initially asked to just quickly create an audition poster. The team liked my design so much they actually altered the set design to match it, and asked me back for the final show poster.

          I started at Iridium as a club-based intern, working daily operations in the restaurant and ticketing areas. At some point I was asked to help with administrative tasks that included extensive scanning and editing of legal forms, and I expedited the process such that it took several days fewer to complete than expected. From there, I was brought on to do more graphic projects under the supervision of the club director and graphic designer, and I experimented with consistent branding and aesthetic styles during my duration with the company.
